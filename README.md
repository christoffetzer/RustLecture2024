# Introduction to Programming Lecture 2024

This repo contains the Rust code from the course "Introduction to Programming" at TU Dresden.
You can build the code, run the code, and modify the code to learn how to program.

## Notes

- In case you have questions or suggestions related to this code, please ask on the Matrix channel of the course.

- In case you are participating in this course and you want to get a copy of the slide decks, please let me know via email.

- I build and compile the code with `nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin` (rustc 1.79.0-nightly). Note that the code uses some Rust features that are right now only available in the nightly toolchain.
