# Introduction to Programming Lecture 2024

This repo contains the Rust code from the lectures.
You can build the code, run the code, and modify the code to learn
from the code.

## Notes

- In case you have questions or suggestions related to this code, please ask on our Matrix channel.

- In case you are not part of the class and want to access to the slides, please let me know via email.

- I build and compile the code with `nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin` (rustc 1.79.0-nightly). Note that the code uses some Rust features that are right now only available in the nightly toolchain.
